        <hr>
        <div class="sectionContent">
          <p> I am a first year computer science student at the University of Virginia,
                in the School of Engineering and Applied Science. And I have a lot more to me than just a software
                 developer! </p>
          <p> I was born in Seattle, WA where I lived for the first 8 years of my life before I moved to Singapore, Singapore,
            and then Jakarta, Indonesia until Northern Virginia for High School. This summer my family relocated again, to Muscat,
            Oman. Below is a photo I took last fall looking into the Gulf of Oman. </p>

    <p>I accredit a lot of who I am to my experiences traveling: they have allowed me to have a better understanding of the world oustide of the United States.</p>
    <p>When I'm not home, I'm here at UVA working hard to learn as much as possible and push myself in and outside of classes. I also love the outdoors, I mountain bike and rock climb frequently: it is important to find a balance with school and enjoying
      the outdoors! </p>

      <p>The screenshot of my official resume does the best job of summarizing all of my relevant CS, and leadership, experience in a concise way. The most important aspect of these experiences is that they demonstrate my ability to succeed in fast-paced,
        and difficult situations: similar to the atmosphere of the Launch program. I have shown consistently that I have the skills to make the most of the Launch program.</p>
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FoqB7EM.png" class="resume">
      <p>Aside from those experiences, I have been working on two side projects since college has started: CavAssistant, and PitchSense. Just like my pursuit of participating in Launch, I seek out projects to be a part of that advance my skills in ways outside
        of school.</p>

    <div class="sectionContent">
      <p>The Launch program provides an extremely unique opportunity in three ways:
        <ul>
          <li>The chance to learn about a Computer Science topic for 8-9 hours a day for 5 days a week for up 6 weeks. No semester, internship, or club, will have any parallel to the amount of experience and focus that this program provides. </li><br>
          <li>The opportunity to work in a startup company over the summer. The atmosphere of a startup company is something special, whichI learned when I participated in the Charlottesville startup trip. The tight knit, new and exciting, ambiance that is
            so pervasive in startups is contagious, and it incredibly enticing. </li><br>
          <li>I would become a HackCville member: which I am extremely passionate about, considering the wealth of opportunity and knowledge that comes with being a member, and being enrolled in a semester program. </li>
